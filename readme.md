# Data Management Implementation Template
-------------------
This repository contains a template for to help you create a Data Management Implementation Document. This document gives specific guidelines to help the researchers in the project to manage data in a coordinated manner. This should be a living document that can be updated during the project as much as it is needed.  

## Instructions for Completing the Template
*Go [HERE](https://github.com/landonma/Data-Management-Templates-Project/blob/master/readme.md) for more detailed instructions*  
Download our [repository](https://github.com/landonma/Data-Management-Implementation-Template) repository which contains the template. Open the template in a text editor. Next fill in your own information and delete the instructions. If you want to use Github Pages upload the edited file into your own repository and enable Github Pages.

## FAQ
### Why do I need an implementation of a Data Management Plan?
Data Management Plans are often submitted with grant proposals. Thus, these plans are written generally, as many details about day to day data management are still not known. Many research groups are also not used to document changes in their data management plan during the research process, so the Data Management Plan becomes less useful.

The goal of this template is both to help research groups make concrete and specific decisions about data management practices, and to make it a living document that can be updated and consulted often.

### Is this a Data Management Plan template?

No, this is a Data Management Plan Implementation template. A Data Management Plan is a document that many funding agencies require be submitted with grant proposals. This template assumes that you already have a Data Management Plan, and that you want to put it into action. This template includes a lot more details than what you want to write in your Data Management Plan.

If you need help to write a Data Management Plan you can:
- Find guidance in [DMPTool.org](https://dmptool.org/)
- Find guidance in [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)
- Find guidance at the library of your institution. Many institutions have wonderful guidance in their websites, and librarians that can help you to write a Data Management Plan.
- If you are a researcher of Oregon State University, you can contact Research Data Services at [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)

### How can I get help to write my own Data Management Plan?
This template is not for writing Data Managment Plans for grant applications. It is to write a living implementation of such Data Management Plans.

If you need help to write a Data Management Plan you can:
- Find guidance in [DMPTool.org](https://dmptool.org/)
- Find guidance in [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)
- Find guidance at the library of your institution. Many institutions have wonderful guidance in their websites, and librarians that can help you to write a Data Management Plan.
- If you are a researcher of Oregon State University, you can contact Research Data Services at [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)

### Does my Data Management Plan Implementation need to be in GitHub?

No, it does not need to be in GitHub. There are a few reasons why we have decided to host this Data Management Plan Implementation Template in GitHub:
- Because you can easily clone our template, edit it, and have a website with your Data Management Plan Implementation. Having a public Data Management Plan Implementation in the form of a website will help your research group because it will make your data management practices transparent, and because everybody in your research group will be able to consult them easily from wherever they are.
- Because it is a tool that many researchers are already familiar with. If you are not one of these researchers, we have created guidelines to help you through the process.
- Because you can edit websites with Markdown. You do not need to know html or other programming languages. Markdown is generally intuitive and easy to learn for most researchers. We have also included a few guidelines for Markdown editing in this template, just in case.

However, there are many reasons why GitHub may not be the right choice for a research project. This template is also accessible as a Word document, a pdf, and a LaTeX document.

### What if I don't have a Data Management Plan?
The assumption of this Data Management Plan Implementation Template is that you have a Data Management Plan that you want to implement. This is the case of many research projects because many funding agencies require data management plans to be submitted with grant proposals. But if this is not your case, you can still use this template! We actually really encourage you to do so. Go ahead and start editing!

### How do I acknowledge that I am using your template?

This template is published under a CC0 license. You are not expected to give attribution, but we will apreciate it if you do. You can include a line to your Data Management Plan or to the readme of your repository saying "This DMP has been generated using the template developed by Clara Llebot Lorente and Mark Landon, working for Research Data Services at the Oregon State University Library. https://github.com/landonma/datamanagement"

### I don't want my data management plan to be openly available. How can I use this template?

Unfortunately, there is no way of hosting a website using GitHub pages and having your pages be private. They will be openly available. You can use other formats of the template that we distribute: Word, pdf, LaTeX.


### Will I find this template useful if I am not from OSU?

We have writen this template as generally as possible so that it is useful to the maximum number of people. However, the guidance document has been written with Oregon State University in mind, so that it is especially useful for researchers of that institution. If you have suggestions about how to improve the template or the guidance so that it is useful, please open an issue or send an e-mail to [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)
