# Data Management Implementation Template
-------------------
This repository contains a template for to help you create a Data Management Implementation Document. This document gives specific guidelines to help the researchers in the project to manage data in a coordinated manner. This should be a living document that can be updated during the project as much as it is needed.  

## Instructions for Completing the Template
*Go [HERE](https://github.com/landonma/Data-Management-Templates-Project/blob/master/readme.md) for more detailed instructions*  
Download our [repository](https://github.com/landonma/Data-Management-Implementation-Template) repository which contains the template. Open the template in a text editor. Next fill in your own information and delete the instructions. If you want to use Github Pages upload the edited file into your own repository and enable Github Pages.

## FAQ
### Why do I need an implementation of a Data Management Plan?
Data Management Plans are often submitted with grant proposals. Thus, these plans are written generally, as many details about day to day data management are still not known. Many research groups are also not used to document changes in their data management plan during the research process, so the Data Management Plan becomes less useful.

The goal of this template is both to help research groups make concrete and specific decisions about data management practices, and to make it a living document that can be updated and consulted often.

### Is this a Data Management Plan template?

No, this is a Data Management Plan Implementation template. A Data Management Plan is a document that many funding agencies require be submitted with grant proposals. This template assumes that you already have a Data Management Plan, and that you want to put it into action. This template includes a lot more details than what you want to write in your Data Management Plan.

If you need help to write a Data Management Plan you can:
- Find guidance in [DMPTool.org](https://dmptool.org/)
- Find guidance in [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)
- Find guidance at the library of your institution. Many institutions have wonderful guidance in their websites, and librarians that can help you to write a Data Management Plan.
- If you are a researcher of Oregon State University, you can contact Research Data Services at [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)

### What if I don't have a Data Management Plan?
The assumption of this Data Management Plan Implementation Template is that you have a Data Management Plan that you want to implement. This is the case of many research projects because many funding agencies require data management plans to be submitted with grant proposals. But if this is not your case, you can still use this template! We actually really encourage you to do so. Go ahead and start editing!

### How do I acknowledge that I am using your template?

This template is published under a CC0 license. You are not expected to give attribution, but we will apreciate it if you do. You can include a line to your Data Management Plan or to the readme of your repository saying "This DMP has been generated using the template developed by Clara Llebot Lorente and Mark Landon, working for Research Data Services at the Oregon State University Library. https://github.com/landonma/datamanagement"


### Will I find this template useful if I am not from OSU?

We have writen this template as generally as possible so that it is useful to the maximum number of people. However, the guidance document has been written with Oregon State University in mind, so that it is especially useful for researchers of that institution. If you have suggestions about how to improve the template or the guidance so that it is useful, please open an issue or send an e-mail to [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu)
